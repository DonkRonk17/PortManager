**Generated:** January 15, 2026  
**Design System:** Beacon HQ Visual System v1.0

## 1. TITLE CARD (Hero Image)
**Dimensions:** 3840×2160 pixels (16:9)  
**Filename:** `PortManager_titlecard.png`

### Prompt:
```
Create a Beacon HQ family title card for PortManager: Smart SSH Connection & Port Forwarding Manager - save SSH profiles with port forwards, quick connect, zero dependencies.

Cinematic 16:9 format (3840×2160). Central logo-style wordmark "PortManager" integrating SSH/networking symbolism (stylized port connections, network nodes, secure tunnel icons, data flow between ports).

Background: futuristic eco-tech environment inspired by Beacon HQ, with photonic circuitry lines and premium materials. Minimal, cinematic, ultra-realistic, crisp edges, tasteful glow, no extra text beyond "PortManager".

Style DNA: Deep glass blues (#1a2332, #2a3f5f, #3a5a7f), cool whites (#e8f4f8, #f0f8ff), subtle teal glow (#00d9ff, #00b8d4), natural greens (#2d5f3f, #3a7f5a). Micro-etched glass, brushed metal, luminous circuit filaments, clean eco landscaping. Subtle photonic border or corner rails.

Constraints: No watermarks, no random words, no extra logos, no clutter, no cartoon style, no distorted geometry. CPUs are rare accents only (1-3 small embedded motifs max, never the main subject).

Clean silhouette, readable at small sizes, optional "PortManager" wordmark variant below or beside the symbol, no extra text.

Dimensions: Primary 1:1 (2048×2048), secondary 3:1 (3072×1024) with wordmark.

**Dimensions:** 1024×1024 pixels (1:1)  
**Filename:** `PortManager_icon.png`

### Prompt:

Create a 1:1 app icon for PortManager in the Beacon HQ suite style: bold central symbol of port forwarding (stylized port connection, tunnel, or network node icon), strong contrast, safe margins, minimal detail that still feels premium, photonic accents, eco-tech feel, no text.

Dimensions: 1024×1024 pixels with safe margins for rounded corners.

Style DNA: Deep glass blues, cool whites, subtle teal glow. Single bold symbol representing SSH connection and port management. High legibility at small sizes (16px-512px).

Background: Subtle gradient from deep blue to teal from Beacon HQ palette. No transparency needed for icon.
